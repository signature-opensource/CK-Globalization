# CK-Globalization

Managing cultures is never easy and is complicated by the legacy issues (see this good
[SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71388328/190380) for an example and refer to https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt
for the BCP47 norm that culture naming follows).

This library is an opinionated one that aims to define a simple, good-enough, i18n workflow that minimizes
the developer's burden. 

It is based on a Code-first approach: the developer writes and emits en-US texts directly in its code, using
interpolated strings. Placeholders are rendered immediately in the culture that MUST be provided: there is **NO
implicit default culture**.

The "current" culture is an injected scoped service (the `CurrentCultureInfo`) or an explicit `ExtendedCultureInfo`.

> **Important:** This library doesn't use the static (and async local) [CultureInfo.CurrentCulture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture).

We currently don't exploit the .NET 8 [CompositeFormat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.compositeformat).
Using it requires more work from the developper: to emit a text, a CompositeFormat in the appropriate culture (the "current" one)
must be located first and then written/formatted with an array of objects. These objects must be compatible in terms of types
and cardinality with the CompositeFormat (possible runtime errors here).
Even if solutions that involve code generation exist like [TypealizR](https://github.com/earloc/TypealizR)
that secures this process by enforcing type safety, this is always more work for the developper.

Our approach is different. Instead of trying to obtain a format (the "enveloppe" of the text) *before* formatting,
we always format a text with a "en" (our default) format but with placeholders rendered in the culture (provided by the DI)
and captures the resulting `Text`, the "current" `TargetCulture` and the placeholders text ranges. Armed with this, we can
*later* applies another format/enveloppe to this text and obtains the "translated" text.

An interesting side-effect of this deferred translation is that the "translation" is not required to be executed on
the original system: the dictionary of translations can reside on a different system in a distributed system, freeing the
"edge agent" of the dictionaries/map cost.

## CultureInfo, NormalizedCultureInfo and ExtendedCultureInfo.
### About CultureInfo. 
CultureInfo have a [`Parent`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.parent),
a more "general culture". This forms a tree with the [`CultureInfo.Invariant`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.invariantculture)
at its root.

The path from a CutureInfo to the Invariant root acts as fallback chain:
```
pa-Guru-IN - Punjabi (Gurmukhi, India)
pa-Guru - Punjabi (Gurmukhi)
pa - Punjabi
Invariant
```
Every culture has 0 or more fallbacks ("fr-FR" fallbacks to "fr").
To capture this fallbacks and unify the API, we introduce the `ExtendedCultureInfo` that is a generalization
of the `NormalizedCultureInfo`. The former normalizes the culture name (as a lower invariant string: culture names
MUST be considered case insensitive) and holds the fallbacks, the latter carries a basic memory cache of
available translations.

Note that for us, the 2 cultures on the path "en" and "" (Invariant) are *de facto* the same and cannot
have any cached translation dictionary.

#### Inventing CultureInfo
CultureInfo can be created freely as long as the name is valid according to the BCP47 rules:
- By calling: `new CultureInfo( "a-valid-name" )`: the CultureInfo can then be mutated.
- By calling `CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo( "a-valid-name" )`: in this case, `CultureInfo.IsReadOnly` is true and it cannot be mutated.

The .NET cache behavior is far from perfect. One cannot create a new CultureInfo out of the blue, configure it and then cache it (which
should freeze it). The name management is surprising: the above name is "normalized" to 'a-VALID-NAME' but cache lookup is always case
insentitive.

The `static bool NormalizedCultureInfo.IsValidCultureName( ReadOnlySpan<char> name )` helper is available to check culture
name syntax but ultimately the framework's `CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo( string name )` decides (and may throw
the badly named `CultureNotFoundException`: InvalidCultureNameException would be better).

```csharp
[Test]
public void inventing_cultures()
{
    FluentActions.Invoking( () => new CultureInfo( "fr-fr-development" ) )
        .Should()
        .Throw<CultureNotFoundException>( "An invalid name (the 'development' subtag is longer than 8 characters) is the only way to not found a culture." );

    // Not cached CultureInfo can be created by newing it.
    {
        var cValid = new CultureInfo( "a-valid-name" );

        var cDevFR = new CultureInfo( "fr-fr-dev" );
        cDevFR.IsReadOnly.Should().BeFalse( "A non cached CultureInfo is mutable." );
        cDevFR.Name.Should().Be( "fr-FR-DEV", "Name is normalized accorcding to BCP47 rules..." );
        cDevFR.Parent.Name.Should().Be( "fr-FR", "The Parent is derived from the - separated subtags." );
        var cDevFRBack = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo( "fr-fr-dev" );
        cDevFRBack.Should().NotBeSameAs( cDevFR, "Not cached." );
    }
    // CultureInfo is cached when CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo is used.
    {
        var cValid = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo( "a-valid-name" );

        var cDevFR = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo( "fr-fr-dev" );
        cDevFR.IsReadOnly.Should().BeTrue( "A cached culture info is read only." );
        cDevFR.Name.Should().Be( "fr-FR-DEV", "Name is normalized accorcding to BCP47 rules..." );
        cDevFR.Parent.Name.Should().Be( "fr-FR", "The Parent is derived from the - separated subtags." );
        var cDevFRBack = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo( "fR-fR-dEv" );
        cDevFRBack.Should().BeSameAs( cDevFR, "...but lookup is case insensitive: this is why our ExtendedCultureInfo.Name is always lowered invariant." );
    }
}
```

We introduce our own cache (reads are lock-free) of `ExtendedCultureInfo`/`NormalizedCultureInfo` that may be used to register
fully "invented cultures" but this is not its primary goal: its primary objective is efficiency and sound normalization of
culture names and fallbacks management.

#### The CultureInfo.LCID obsolescence
This property is very convenient (notably for database mapping) as it provides an integer identifier. Unfortunately, it should
no more be used as it was bound to Windows NLS sub-system implementation. ICU (that replaces NLS on .NET) has no integer identifier.

We introduce a new identifier, the `ExtendedCultureInfo.Id` that is the DBJ2 hash of our normalized culture name. This is somehow fragile
since collisions can occur but our tests have shown that they are quite exceptional and for very "artificial" fallbacks. Clashes are
detected and an explicit identifier assignation is done in such case.

> If this happens, this HAS TO BE HANDLED quickly and the clash must be hard coded in this library order
for the identifier to be shared accross systems.

This mechanism is a bet. Clashes should occur if a really big number of cultures are used. If managing the
"exceptions" happens to be unbearable, then we may extend the int identifier to a long (64 bits).

## Culture fallbacks
### ExtendedCultureInfo and NormalizedCultureInfo 
For (regular) `NormalizedCultureInfo` fallbacks are based on the `CultureInfo.Parent` path provided by the
.NET framework and cannot be altered: these are "intrinsic fallbacks".

"Intrinsic fallbacks" must be understood as "I'd prefer a translation adapted to my region (.NET Specific Culture
concept) if there's one, but I'm fine with any translation in my language (.NET Neutral Culture)".

We call "pure" `ExtendedCultureInfo` the cultures that are not `NormalizedCultureInfo`: these ones are
defined by their fallbacks and represent a "user preference list" (comma separated list of normalized
culture names): "jp,es,fr" is japanese first, then spanish and then french before giving up and use
the "en" default. This capability introduces some complexity and needs some design decisions discussed
below.

For translations, the `NormalizedCultureInfo` and its intrinsic fallbacks can be "good enough": the placeholders
are rendered in the primary culture ("es-ES" for instance). If we can't find a composite format from the
"en" code text to "es-ES" nor to "es" then we simply don't translate/reformat and expose the "en" text
with its "es-ES" placeholders. Translations SHOULD exist: the failure to find a translation is an exception,
a bug or an issue that must be fixed. Translations are a compact set of resources: there should be no "holes"
in them.

The "user preference list" notion supports another usage: it enables the **selection** of the "best" resource among
a possibly scarce set of translated resources. A typical use case is a document library that contains some
translated documents (but not all are translated). A pure `ExtendedCultureInfo` is identified by its comma separated
fallback names.

### Discussion: Translation vs. Selection, fallbacks normalization 
Our goal with the `ExtendedCultureInfo` is to support both scenario, even if our primary focus is about
translations. Unfortunately, these two usages possibly require/imply different interprations of the "user
preference list".

#### Fallbacks semantics
In both scenario, it is obvious that a parent culture (intrinsic fallback) appearing before a culture is stupid:
"es,fr,fr-ca" is either "es,fr-ca,fr" or "es,fr" because whatever is the resource (a document or a translated
resource), a "fr-ca" resource IS-A "fr" resource.

But then interpretations differ. About the "en" code default for instance:

- For translation, due to:
  - Our choice of "en" code defaults,
  - **and**, as we are NOT implementing a "general purpose i18n" library, we don't support
    translating an already translated string (translations always start from a "en", code emitted text),
    there is no point to have the default in a "user preference list": "en" is automatically removed.
- For selection, "fr,en,es" is a perfectly valid preference list: our "en" code default doesn't make sense
  in the context of a "document library".

> Fallbacks for translation and selection actually differ (at least for the "en" handling).

Let's consider this user preference: "pa-guru-in,es,fr-ca".
- For translation:
  - The placeholders have been rendered in "pa-guru-in" (the PrimaryCulture). It doesn't make sense to lookup for "es"
    if a translation in "pa-guru" or "pa" exists: intrinsic fallbacks should be honored first, at least for the PrimaryCulture.
  - The lookup list is: "pa-guru-in,pa-guru,pa,es,fr-ca,fr"
- For selection:
  - It is less obvious. What is the user intent? The lookup list may be the same as above or should we strictly honor the
    list by putting the intrinsic fallbacks after it, leading to "pa-guru-in,es,fr-ca,pa-guru,pa,fr"?.
  - This can be discussed but we'll keep the translation proposal here.

We previously stated that a "more general" culture cannot precede a specific one ("fr,fr-ca" is "fr"). Now let's
consider the "more than one specific cultures" case: "fr-ca, fr-ch". This makes sense: before falling back to the general "fr", the user would
like to have a canadian or switzerland specific resource. But what about this: "fr-ca, es, fr-ch"? This doesn't make sense
for translations (and is rather strange for selection) but "fr-ch" appears, it would be annoying to purely ignore it.

The normalization described below handles all these case.

#### Normalization
Normalization of a preference list can be done by applying the following rules:
- First, cultures are grouped by common parent, preserving the relative order of the children: groups are ordered based on
  the first occurence of itself or one of its more specific cultures.
- Then, groups are written, specific culture names coming first, ending with the parent cultures' name.

_Note:_ This normalization process is not based on the string names but on the hierarchy provided by the
CultureInfo objects. 

Examples:
- "fr,fr-ch,es,fr-ca" is normalized into "fr-ch,fr-ca,fr,es".
- "fr-fr,es,en-gb,es-bo,pa-guru" becomes "fr-fr,fr,es-bo,es,en-gb,en,pa-guru,pa"

This process is sound: it corrects what can be seen as "stupid input" (without losing any specified cultures) and is consistent
for translations and selections provided that for translations, we consider the "en" culture to
end the list (only "fr-fr,fr,es-bo,es,en-gb" will be considered for translations).

## NormalizedCulture cached transtations
All NormalizedCulture (except the "en" and Invariant default ones) can have a cached translation set of resources.
It can always be set (the new one replaces the current one). This is a thread safe atomic operation:

```csharp
public IReadOnlyList<GlobalizationIssues.Issue> SetCachedTranslations( IEnumerable<(string ResName, string Format)> map )
```
The `Format` string is a positional-only composite format (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/composite-formatting):
only `{0}`, `{1}` etc. placeholders are allowed, without alignement nor format specifier. This format string is parsed and kept as a structure
optimized to generate strings. If the format cannot be parsed successfully, a `GlobalizationIssues.ResourceFormatError` is emitted.

As discussed before, translations must be "compact": a resource defined in "es-es" MUST be defined in "es" but because translations can be
set in any order (specific "es-es" before more generic "es") and setting the set is a lock-free operation, we don't check this
requirement. If a neutral (top culture like "es") misses a resource, a `GlobalizationIssues.MissingTranslationResource` will be emitted.

## ITranslationService and MCString.
The translation is primarily synchronous and relies on the basic cached translations carried by
the `NormalizedCultureInfo`. It can be specialized with more advanced caching capabilities and may
support asynchronous translation.

```csharp
public class TranslationService : ISingletonAutoService
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Does its best to ensure that the returned <see cref="MCString.FormatCulture"/> is aligned with
    /// the <see cref="CodeString.TargetCulture"/> based on the available memory cached translations.
    /// <para>
    /// This is a synchronous method that works on the cached memory translations.
    /// </para>
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="s">The string to translate.</param>
    /// <returns>A string with a format culture aligned to its content culture if possible.</returns>
    public virtual MCString Translate( CodeString s ) { ... }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets whether <see cref="TranslateAsync(CodeString)"/> should be called because
    /// external translations repository may be exploited.
    /// <para>
    /// Always false for this default implementation.
    /// </para>
    /// </summary>
    public virtual bool SupportAsyncTranslation => false;

    /// <summary>
    /// Asynchronous translation that can use external translations repository to retrieve a missing translation.
    /// <para>
    /// This default implementation simply calls the synchronous <see cref="Translate(CodeString)"/>.
    /// This may be overridden if translations may be obtained from external
    /// repositories (and an async call is made to this method before returning
    /// a MCString).
    /// </para>
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="s">The code string to translate.</param>
    /// <returns>A string with a format culture aligned to its content culture if possible.</returns>
    public virtual ValueTask<MCString> TranslateAsync( CodeString s )
    {
        return new ValueTask<MCString>( Translate( s ) );
    }
}
```
The translated `MCString` wraps its source `CodeString` and exposes the `FormatCulture`, the translated `Text`
and a translation quality.

## The ExtendedCultureInfo is an Ubiquitous Endpoint Service.
The notion of "current culture" should better be named "ambient culture". As usual, this "ambient" notion
should be handled explicitly rather than relying on thread static, async-local-is-evil and other global
state management.

A `ExtendedCultureInfo` exists in any DI container and methods that need it have simply to require this
service. An there is more: the `CurrentCultureInfo` is a scoped service that captures the ubiquitous
`ExtendedCultureInfo` and the `TranslationService`: this CurrentCultureInfo enables a `MCString` to be
directly translated:

```csharp
return MCString.Create( culture, $"Hello {name}!", "SayHello" );
```
If the `culture` is a `CurrentCultureInfo` with a french culture and the cached translation on the 'fr'
`NormalizedCulture` contains the mapping {"SayHello","Bonjour {0}!"}, then the string is immediately
translated.

Note that this can only use the synchronous `TranslationService.Translate` method. If async translations
must be done, they have to be deferred (in an async context).

This immediate translation capability is available on the `ResultMessage` helper, the `MCString.Create`
factory method, but the `CurrentCultureInfo` itself exposes helpers that can easily create `MCString`,
`UserMessage` and `MCException`: these are the ones that should be used more often.

## Globalization types marshalling.
The 5 fundamental types `ExtendedCultureInfo`, `NormalizedCultureInfo`, `FormattedString`, `CodeString`
and `ResultMessage` are serializable both with the simple and versioned simple binary serialization.

However, we don't always want to carry all the information these types hold. In such case, these types
can be "simplified":
- The culture informations are are always marshalled by their name (simple string): calling
  `ExtendedCultureInfo.GetExtendedCultureInfo( name )` restores the corresponding culture info (be it
  a `NormalizedCultureInfo` or not).
- The formatted and code strings can be considered as simple strings, they can be implictly cast into string
  (that is their respective `Text` property).
- `UserMessage` can be implicitly cast into `SimpleUserMessage` that holds the `Level`, `Depth` and
  the `Message` as a mere string.

With these projected types, all culture related information on strings is lost. They can typically be used
when exchanging with a "front" application that doesn't have to worry about translations.

Json support is available for all these objects in the static `GlobalizationJsonHelper` helper (Json
serialization doesn't pollute the API). The Json format uses array of values to be as compact as
possible.

## MCException
The `MCException` has a `MCString Message { get; }` (hides the base `Exception.Message` property that is the `MCString.Text`).
It has numerous constructors. This type enables to throw culture aware exceptions and support a simple feature that is to secure
a little bit the _exception leak_ issue.

An extension method can recursively extract all `UserMessage` (with their depth) from an exception's message and its children.

```csharp
public static List<UserMessage> GetUserMessages( this Exception ex,
                                                 CurrentCultureInfo? culture,
                                                 string? defaultGenericMessage = "An unhandled error occurred.",
                                                 byte depth = 0,
                                                 bool? leakAll = null )
```

The `leakAll` parameter states whether all exceptions must be exposed or only the `MCException` ones. When null, it defaults
to `CoreApplicationIdentity.IsDevelopmentAndInitialized`: we want to be sure to be in "#Dev" environment to leak the exceptions.

The idea here is that if the developper took the time to emit a `MCException` rather than a mere exception, this exception is then
"safe enough" to be displayed to an end user.

## The ResName is optional but important.
When a developper is in a hurry, he may not have time to choose and set a resource name for a CodeString.
In this case, an automatic resource name is computed: "SHA.v8xu6U8beqBaBHUJA-Jfk6cYiuA" for instance
is the default resource name of the plain text "text" (it is the base64url encoding of the SHA1 of the
format string).

This resource name can perfectly be used in the translation resources: the developper is not required
to choose a resource name. Translations can come later and provided without necessarily updating the
source code... or never if English is fine.

SHA1 automatic resource names never clash by design. When multiple locations in source code create
the same CodeString, their SHA1 are equal and the same resource will apply to all of them. If a developper
changes one of them, it will become "untranslated" until a dedicated resource is provided.

Explicit resource names seems better, but the same name can be defined by 2 different developpers (in 2
modules) with a totally different format string.

SHA1 or explicit, managing resource names requires to take care of: 
- A change in the number of placeholders (the user will see messages with "holes" in them).
- The removal of a CodeString (the resource will be defined for ever, polluting the system).

The good news is that all these issues *can be* tracked automatically. The bad news is that it requires
some work of course to analyze and correct these issues. The worst case is when a CodeString disappears:
ideally a Code Analyzer would discover all the CodeString and generate an embedded resource with the list
of all the CodeString, source code location and hash of the format string.
Currently this analysis is done dynamically.

## The GlobalizationIssues.
The `GlobalizationIssues` static class centralizes the collect of issues and raises `OnNewIssue` event.
It is driven by a StaticGate:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The "CK.Core.GlobalizationIssues.Track" static gate is closed by default.
/// </summary>
public static readonly StaticGate Track;
```
Issues that are dynamically analyzed are:

- Calls to `NormalizedCultureInfo.SetCachedTranslations` can raise `TranslationDuplicateResource`
  and `TranslationFormatError` these issues are only emitted by `OnNewIssue` and logged.
  They are not collected (they are also returned to the caller of SetCachedTranslations).
- `MissingTranslationResource` is emitted whenever a Bad or Awful translation is detected.
- `FormatArgumentCountError` is emitted whenever a translation format expects less or more arguments
  than a CodeString placeholders contains.
- The worst case: `CultureIdentifierClash` is always raised, even if the static gate `Track` is closed.
  This is a serious issue that must be urgently adressed.

`MissingTranslationResource` and `FormatArgumentCountError` events are memorized and the corresponding event
is raised only once.

All dynamic issues (except the `TranslationDuplicateResource` and `TranslationFormatError`) can be retrieved thanks
to the `GetReportAsync` method:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Obtains a <see cref="Report"/> with the detected issues so far.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>The current issues.</returns>
public static Task<Report> GetReportAsync() { ... }
```

The `GlobalizationIssues.Report` exposes the dynamic issues plus 3 other computed issues:

- `AutomaticResourceNamesCanUseExistingResName` when anutomatic "SHA.XXX" resource name can reuse
  an existing explicit ResName.
- `ResourceNamesCanBeMerged` when different resource names are used for the same CodeString format:
  they may be merged.
- `SameResNameWithDifferentFormat` when the same resource name identifies different CodeString formats.
  This is bad and should be corrected.

## Future
A static Code Analyzer should discover CodeString and generate a resource file that contains the CodeString
source location, the format string and its hash. A CKSetup component could then detect `AutomaticResourceNamesCanUseExistingResName`,
`ResourceNamesCanBeMerged` and `SameResNameWithDifferentFormat` when compiling the final application and a new
`TranslationUselessResource` could then be immediately emitted when setting a translation cache.
